# Peerbit Shared FS Native Adapter

Experimental native mount adapter for `@peerbit/shared-fs`.

This adapter speaks the shared-fs JSON-lines IPC protocol and mounts the
filesystem through [cgofuse](https://github.com/winfsp/cgofuse), which supports:

- Linux: FUSE/libfuse
- macOS: macFUSE
- Windows: WinFsp

Build a native adapter binary with:

```bash
go build -tags native_mount -o peerbit-shared-fs-native .
```

On Linux with FUSE3 headers, use:

```bash
go build -tags "native_mount fuse3" -o peerbit-shared-fs-native .
```

The adapter is normally launched by `peerbit-fs mount --native-adapter`, but can
also be run directly:

```bash
peerbit-shared-fs-native --endpoint tcp://127.0.0.1:12345 --mountpoint /mnt/shared
```

The endpoint is provided by the TypeScript Peerbit daemon. TCP loopback is used
for external adapters so the same IPC transport works on Linux, macOS, and
Windows.
